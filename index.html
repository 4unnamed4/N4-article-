                <h2>Cybercriminal N4 Breaks Into Cloudflare</h2>
                <p>In a shocking development, an infamous hacker, known as <strong>N4</strong>, has allegedly infiltrated the systems of <strong>Cloudflare</strong>, one of the world's leading cybersecurity firms.

                <h2>The Hack and Its Impact</h2>
                <p>The hack, which reportedly took place several weeks ago, has raised concerns across the cybersecurity community. Cloudflare's extensive client base, which includes major corporations, financial institutions, and government entities, may be at risk, though there has been no confirmation of any data leakage so far.</p>

                <p>Experts believe N4 utilized a sophisticated exploit to gain entry into Cloudflare's internal network. Once inside, the hacker has been leveraging their presence to gather information while evading detection. The breach has been described as one of the most dangerous attacks on cloud infrastructure in recent years.</p>

                <h2>Ongoing Investigation</h2>
                <p>Cloudflare has acknowledged the incident but has yet to release a detailed statement about the extent of the breach. The company is currently cooperating with law enforcement, including the <strong>Cybersecurity and Cybercrimes Police Taskforce</strong>, in an ongoing investigation.</p>

                <p>Authorities are working around the clock to identify the whereabouts of N4 within Cloudflare's systems and to mitigate any potential damage. "We are treating this case with the utmost priority," a spokesperson for the taskforce said. "Our team is tracking every move, but this hacker has proven to be elusive."</p>

                <h2>Who is N4?</h2>
                <p>N4 is a well-known figure in the hacking community, infamous for targeting high-profile companies and organizations. While the identity of N4 remains unknown, the hacker is rumored to be behind several previous cyberattacks over the past few years.</p>

                <p>The motivation for this latest attack remains unclear, but some speculate it may be financially driven, while others suggest it could be a form of protest or challenge to the cybersecurity industry.</p>

                <h2>Whatâ€™s Next?</h2>
                <p>The cyberattack on Cloudflare has left the industry on edge, as security experts and law enforcement agencies around the world continue to monitor the situation.
